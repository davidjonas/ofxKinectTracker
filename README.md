# ofxKinectTracker
OpenFrameworks addon to track people or objects from the depth image generated by a kinect. Optimized by default for tracking people from above (kinect pointing at the floor). but it can track in any type of setup.
It also supports multiple Kinects to track bigger spaces with more resolution.

# Kinect
This addon was made for the Kinect 360 (the old version). If you are going to buy one then I recommend build 1414 (check the bottom of the Kinect base for build number).
If you want a mount to put your Kinect on a tripod or any standard support then you can print one from my design at [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2774039)

# Installing
Just clone (or download) this repository to your addons folder inside the OpenFrameworks installation. Check the example for basic usage. Use the project generator to add the addon to your new or existing projects.
